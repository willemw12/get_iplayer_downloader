get_iplayer_downloader is a download utility for the BBC get_iplayer program.

This program is a graphical version of the command "get_iplayer --tree", followed by "get_iplayer --pid" or "get_iplayer --info". It displays programmes in a large treeview with two main columns: serie title and episode title plus description.

It is a small utility program for me to try and find out what standard Python and GTK+ 3 can do, after creating a version of the downloader with zenity in bash, which was far too slow.

This program works best with a screen resolution of 1024x768 or higher.

I let the downloads run in one or more terminal windows, so I can see when a download fails or hangs.

This program is licensed under GPLv3 (see included file COPYING).

Disclaimer: this program doesn't do any downloading itself. It relies on the get_iplayer program to do the actual downloading.



Dependencies
============

get_iplayer and its dependencies (http://www.infradead.org/get_iplayer/html/get_iplayer.html).

Python (2.7). Python setuptools (to run setup.py). GNOME libraries for Python (GTK+ 3, ...).

Linux (only to run get_iplayer in a terminal window and to display the number of running get_iplayer processes). This program may work on other platforms, however that has not been tested.



Configuration
=============

1) get_iplayer

Create and configure get_iplayer presets files ~/.get_iplayer/presets/tv and ~/.get_iplayer/presets/radio for tv, radio and podcasts (tvmode, radiomode, ...). Now "get_iplayer --preset=radio ..." and "get_iplayer --preset=tv" should work properly from the command line. The preset file names are configurable.

Optionally, setup a get_iplayer pvr scheduler (cronjob) to download queued programmes.

2) get_iplayer_downloader

Most configuration settings can be managed from the GUI. Other settings can be found in the configuration file (~/get_iplayer_downloader/config), which will be created after running the program for the first time.

Before downloading programmes, check the download paths and terminal emulator program name in the GUI or in the configuration file.

The configured channels and categories are a reduced set and don't contain all available values. To start off with category lists containing all available categories, run:

    <path to this directory>/src/get_iplayer_downloader.py --print-categories

and put the printed output in the configuration file. The same can be done for channels (--print-channels) or leave the channel lists empty to search all channels.



Installation
============

To execute without installing, run:

    <path to this directory>/src/get_iplayer_downloader.py

Or to install, run from this directory:

    sudo python setup.py install
    sudo rm -rf build

Then to execute, run:

    get_iplayer_downloader

If python 2 (2.7 or higher) and python 3 are both installed and the name of the python 2 executable is python2, then replace the first two commands above by:

    python2 <path to this directory>/src/get_iplayer_downloader.py
    sudo python2 setup.py install



Shortcut keys
=============

alt + enter     Properties  View properties of highlighted programme (of programme in focus)
ctrl + d        Download    Download or queue selected programmes

Extra
=====

File ./src/extra/get_iplayer_post_subdir.py is a get_iplayer post-processing script. It is an extension to the get_iplayer subdir output option. The script supports additional property substitutions (<category>, <week>, ...). Run ./extra/get_iplayer_post_subdir.py --help for more information.

To install and configure the script, copy or link the script to a directory in $PATH, for example:

    ln -s <path to this directory>/src/extra/get_iplayer_post_subdir.py ~/bin/get_iplayer_post_subdir.py

or add a path in front of the command below. Put for example in ~/.get_iplayer/presets/tv:

    command get_iplayer_post_category.py --categories="<categories>" --dir="<dir>" --filename="<filename>" --subdir-format="bbc.<week>/<categorymain>_<category>/<longname>"
