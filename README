get_iplayer_downloader is a download utility for the BBC get_iplayer program.

This program is a graphical version of the command "get_iplayer --tree", followed by "get_iplayer --pid" or "get_iplayer --info". It displays programmes in a large treeview with two main columns: serie title and episode title plus description.

It is a small utility program for me to try and find out what can be done with standard Python and GTK+ 3. This is after I tried creating a version of the downloader with zenity in bash, which was far too slow.

You can continue using the program, while get_iplayer is downloading in the background. I let the downloads run in one or more terminal windows, so I can see when a download hangs or fails.

This program works best with a screen resolution of 1024x768 or higher.

This program is licensed under GPLv3 (see included file COPYING).

Disclaimer: this program doesn't do any downloading itself. It relies on the get_iplayer program to do the actual downloading.



Dependencies
============

get_iplayer and its dependencies (http://www.infradead.org/get_iplayer/html/get_iplayer.html).

Python (2.7). Python setuptools (to run setup.py). GNOME libraries for Python (GTK+ 3, ...).

Linux (only required to run get_iplayer in a terminal window). This program may work on other platforms, however, that has not been tested.



Configuration
=============

1) get_iplayer

Create and configure get_iplayer presets files ~/.get_iplayer/presets/tv and ~/.get_iplayer/presets/radio for tv, radio and podcasts (tvmode, radiomode, ...). Now "get_iplayer --preset=radio ..." and "get_iplayer --preset=tv" should work properly from the command line. The preset file names are configurable.

Optionally, setup a get_iplayer pvr scheduler (cronjob) to download queued programmes.

2) get_iplayer_downloader

Most configuration settings can be managed from the GUI. Other settings can be found in the configuration file (~/.config/get_iplayer_downloader/get_iplayer_downloader.conf), which will be created after running the program for the first time. Make sure the program is not running, before editing the configuration file.

Before starting to download programmes for the first time, verify the download paths and terminal emulator program name in the GUI or in the configuration file.

The preconfigured search channels and categories are a reduced set. To start off with category lists containing all available categories, run:

    get_iplayer --preset=radio --flush
    get_iplayer --preset=tv --flush
    <path to this directory>/src/get_iplayer_downloader.py --list-categories --quiet

and put the printed output in the configuration file. The same can be done for channels (get_iplayer_downloader.py --list-channels) or clear the configured channel lists to search in all channels.



Installation
============

To execute without installing, run:

    <path to this directory>/src/get_iplayer_downloader.py

There are several ways to install the program.

1)

Run from this directory:

    ./install.sh

Then to execute, run:

    get_iplayer_downloader

or run it from the desktop menu.

To uninstall, run from this directory:

    ./uninstall.sh

If python 2 (2.7 or higher) and python 3 are both installed and the name of the python 2 executable is python2, then replace the first command above by:

    python2 <path to this directory>/src/get_iplayer_downloader.py

and update the install.sh and uninstall.sh scripts.

2)

For Debian/Ubuntu, build and install a .deb file:

    # Install build and package tools
    sudo apt-get install python-stdeb

    # Create a .deb file in directory deb_dist from Python setuptools (distutils) files
    python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb

    # Install one .deb file
    sudo dpkg -i deb_dist/python-get-iplayer-downloader_*_all.deb
    rm -rf deb_dist/

3)

For Arch Linux there are PKGBUILD files, for example:

    mkdir -p ~/abs/get_iplayer_downloader-git
    cd ~/abs/get_iplayer_downloader-git
    wget https://github.com/willemw12/get_iplayer_downloader/raw/master/src/extra/abs/get_iplayer_downloader-git/PKGBUILD
    #makepkg -s --skipchecksums
    makepkg -s
    sudo pacman -U get_iplayer_downloader-git-*-any.pkg.tar.xz

Extra
=====

File ./src/extra/get_iplayer_post_subdir.py is a get_iplayer post-processing script. It is an extension to the get_iplayer subdir output option. The script supports additional property substitutions (<category>, <week>, ...) in the output subdirectory names. For more information, run:

    ./extra/get_iplayer_post_subdir.py --help 

To install and configure, copy or link the script to a directory in $PATH, for example:

    ln -s <absolute path to this directory>/src/extra/get_iplayer_post_subdir.py ~/bin/get_iplayer_post_subdir.py

or add a path in front of the command below. Then put, for example, in ~/.get_iplayer/presets/tv:

    command get_iplayer_post_category.py --categories="<categories>" --dir="<dir>" --filename="<filename>" --subdir-format="bbc.<week>/<categorymain>_<category>/<longname>"
