get_iplayer_downloader is a download utility for the BBC get_iplayer program.

This program is a graphical version of the command "get_iplayer --tree", followed by "get_iplayer --pid" or "get_iplayer --info". It displays all the found programmes in a large treeview with two main columns: serie title and episode title plus description.

It is a small utility program for me to try and find out what Python and GTK+ 3 can do, after creating a version of the downloader with zenity in bash, which was far too slow.

This program works best with a screen resolution of 1024x768 or higher.

I let the downloads run in one or more terminal windows, so I can see when and which download fails or hangs.

This program is licensed under GPLv3 (see file COPYING).

Disclaimer: this program doesn't do any downloading itself. It relies on the get_iplayer program to do the actual downloading.



Dependencies
============

get_iplayer and its dependencies (http://www.infradead.org/get_iplayer/html/get_iplayer.html).

Python (2.7). Python setuptools (to run setup.py). GNOME libraries for Python (GTK+ 3, etc.).

Linux (to run get_iplayer in a terminal window and to display the number of running get_iplayer processes).



Configuration
=============

1) get_iplayer

Configure get_iplayer presets "tv" and "radio" for tv, radio and podcasts (files ~/.get_iplayer/presets/tv and ~/.get_iplayer/presets/radio). Settings should preferable include:

    "tvmode=..." and "radiomode=...": the default download modes

Now "get_iplayer --preset=radio ..." and "get_iplayer --preset=tv" should work properly from the command line.

Optionally, setup a get_iplayer pvr scheduler (cronjob).

Note: get_iplayer has a fixed download list size (info_limit = 40).

2) get_iplayer_downloader

Most configuration settings can be managed from the GUI (right-click, Preferences). Before downloading, check the download paths in the GUI. Other settings can be found in the configuration file (~/get_iplayer_downloader/config, which will be created after running the program for the first time). The default BBC programme settings (channel lists and category lists) are configured according to my preference and don't contain all possible values.



Installation
============

To execute without installing, run:

    <path to this folder>/src/get_iplayer_downloader.py

Or to install, run from this folder:

    sudo python setup.py install
    sudo rm -rf build

Then to execute, run:

    get_iplayer_downloader

If python 2 (2.7 or higher) and python 3 are both installed and the name of the python 2 executable is python2, then replace the first two commands above by:

    python2 <path to this folder>/src/get_iplayer_downloader.py
    sudo python2 setup.py install
